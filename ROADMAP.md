# AiPulse Roadmap

A running backlog of ideas, most of them sourced from comparing AiPulse against real competitors (Glance, Miniflux, FreshRSS, Horizon, auto-news, RSSbrew, ai-news-aggregator) — see the analysis this list grew out of for citations. Grouped by whether it fits AiPulse's core positioning: **standalone, self-hosted, zero AI required**.

Status tags: ✅ done · 🟢 fits philosophy, no AI needed · 🟡 needs a design call · 🔴 conflicts with positioning (listed for completeness, not recommended)

## ✅ Shipped

- OPML import/export (bulk source management), with a reachability check on every newly imported URL
- Cross-source deduplication (title-similarity merge, "+N more sources")
- Weekly Digest page (7-day rollup, biggest multi-source stories)
- Multi-user accounts: registration, admin approval, Admin/User roles, per-user bookmarks/watchlist/chat history
- Desktop notifications (releases + watchlist), keyword watchlist
- Regex/boolean exclude filters (the inverse of the watchlist — hide matching items entirely)
- Full keyboard navigation on the News feed (j/k/o/Enter/m/b/?)
- Source health/uptime history (rolling 30-day % per source on the Sources page)
- Tracking-param stripping from feed links (utm_*, fbclid, gclid, etc.)
- XPath-based scraping for sites with no RSS/Atom feed at all
- Full-text fetching for summary-only feeds (readability-style extraction, cached per link)
- WebSub/PubSubHubbub push - subscribes to any feed that declares a hub so it pushes updates to us
  instead of us polling. Opt-in via `WebSub:PublicBaseUrl`; inert (and untested-in-the-wild as of this
  writing - see note below) otherwise.
- Learning Hub, Glossary, Tools & Tips, Explore (HF/GitHub trending), Playground (local Ollama chat)
- Backup/restore, Obsidian export, global search, light/dark theme

> **WebSub reality check:** none of AiPulse's ~40 default sources currently declare a hub (checked YouTube,
> WordPress.com, Feedburner, Blogger - all previously reliable examples, none do anymore). The subscribe/
> verify/HMAC-signature/renew mechanics are built and directly verified (simulated hub requests against
> the callback endpoints), but real end-to-end delivery depends on a source that still runs a hub, which
> is now rare. It'll activate automatically the day one of your sources adds one - nothing to configure
> beyond `WebSub:PublicBaseUrl`.

## 🟡 Valuable, needs a design decision

| Idea | Source | The decision |
|---|---|---|
| **Outbound webhooks** (Slack/Discord/generic POST) | Horizon, Miniflux, NewsBlur (IFTTT/Zapier) | Desktop notifications only fire while a tab is open. A webhook reaches you anywhere — but needs per-user webhook URL storage and a retry/failure policy. |
| **Mobile client API compatibility** (Google Reader / Fever API) | FreshRSS, Miniflux | Would let you read AiPulse in existing RSS apps (Reeder, FeedMe) — meaningful surface area to implement and maintain a compat API. |
| **Multiple visual themes + custom CSS** | Glance | Currently just light/dark. Decide: curated theme presets, or expose a raw custom-CSS box (more powerful, more support burden). |
| **General-purpose custom widgets** (iframe/HTML/custom-API) | Glance | Biggest architectural addition on this list — turns AiPulse into a general dashboard, not just an AI-news one. Worth asking "do we want that scope?" before building. |
| **Read-it-later integrations** (Pocket/Instapaper-style export) | NewsBlur, FreshRSS | Obsidian export already covers one destination; decide if others are worth the integration surface. |
| **Persist notification "seen" state across restarts** | — | Right now `FeedWatcherService` re-seeds its dedup set on every restart, so nothing alerts in the first cycle after a restart even if it's genuinely new. Needs a small persisted "last seen" store. |

## 🔴 Conflicts with "no AI" positioning (not recommended, listed for completeness)

- AI-based story scoring/ranking or summarization (Horizon, auto-news, RSSbrew)
- Translation (ai-news-aggregator)
- AI-generated community-comment digests (Horizon)

## How to pick what's next

Ask: does it need an LLM? (if yes, skip per current positioning) → does it need new infrastructure (public callback endpoint, external API compat layer)? (if yes, it's a bigger lift, sequence it later) → otherwise it's fair game for the next session.
